# Module 13 Challenge - Spam Detector 

## Background

We are an Internet Service Provider (ISP) and we've been tasked with improving the email filtering system for its customers. We've been provided with a dataset that contains information about emails, with two possible classifications: spam and not spam. The ISP wants us to take this dataset and develop a supervised machine learning (ML) model that will accurately detect spam emails so it can filter them out of its customers' inboxes.

We'll be creating two classification models to fit the provided data, and evaluate which model is more accurate at detecting spam. The models you'll create will be a logistic regression model and a random forest model.
